# movies

***This repository is part of a job application.***

I created this project using Create React App and APIs from the Open Movie Database (omdb).

This app includes 2 components: a parent component for the main page, and a child component for the movie cards.

***Parent Component: App.js***

URLs are created by adding individual movie titles and my key to the omdb API. Movie titles are stored in an array, called pelicula, and the newMovie() function turns the titles into URLs, which are stored in the movieArray. 

In the componentDidMount() function, I loop through the movieArray and fetch() data from each URL. Then I use .push to add the new data to the end of the movieInfo array, which is stored in the constructor, and then setting the state to the new array, using this.setState.

In the render() method, I mapped over the movieInfo array, in order to render one MovieCard component for each movie stored in the original movie titles array, pelicula.

***Child Component: MovieCard***

I rendered each movie's title, poster (image), genre, release date, rating, website, and awards using this.props.movie. I added an anchor tage to the website element, to create a hyper-link on the webpage.

Since the movie ratings are stored in a nested array, I set the array equal to the variable 'ratings.' I rendered the ratings by taking the appropriate index for each value [0][0], [0][1], and [0][2], then selecting either .Source or .Value, as appropriate.

I styled the Movie Card component using ReactBootstrap (Grid, Row, Col, and Table).
