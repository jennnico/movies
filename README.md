# movies

***This repository is part of a job application.***

I created this project using Create React App and APIs from the Open Movie Database (omdb).

This app includes 2 components: one for the main page, and one for the movie cards.

URLs are created using tby adding individual movie titles and my key to the omdb API. Movie titles are stored in an array. Data is retrieved using $ajax

I styled the Movie Card component using ReactBootstrap (Grid, Row, and Col). Titles and images are hard-coded into each movie card.

I am currently working on having each movie card display data for each individual movie.
